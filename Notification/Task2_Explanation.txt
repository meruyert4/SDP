Task 2:
You are tasked with developing a notification system that can send notifications via different
channels: SMS, Email, and Push Notification. Each notification channel has a different
implementation, but they should follow a unified interface.
The system should be flexible, allowing you to add new notification types (e.g., Slack
Notification) without modifying the existing code. Additionally, the system must support
sending bulk notifications to multiple users via any notification channel.
1. Design the system following the SOLID principles to ensure it is maintainable and
extendable.
2. Implement the solution in Java with at least three notification types:
o SMSNotification
o EmailNotification
o PushNotification


Which Solid Principles i added:
1. Single Responsibility Principle
2. Open/Closed Principle
3. Dependency Inversion Principle

HOW TO RUN?
1. Open Terminal
2. Navigate to root directory which is SDP
3. run in terminal: javac -d out Notification/notifications/*.java Notification/main/Main.java
4. run main: java -cp out main.Main
5. Done
