Task 1:
You are tasked with building a system that generates different types of documents: PDFs
and Word files. Each document type has its own creation process. You want to ensure that
the creation of these documents is flexible and that the system can easily support new
document types in the future.
1. Which Creational Design Pattern would be most appropriate for this scenario? Why?
2. Implement a basic example using this pattern in Java.
o PDFDocument: Displays the message "PDF Document created."
o WordDocument: Displays the message "Word Document created."
Hint: Focus on creating a system where new document types can be added without
changing the existing code.

What SOLID Principles i used:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    Each class has one job.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
    Extendable without code modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
    Subclasses replace parent class easily.
4. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    Depend on abstractions, not implementations.

What Design Patterns i used:
1. Factory Method Pattern:
    Creates objects via factories.
