Which Solid Principles i used:
1. Single Responsibility Principle:
    Each payment class (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment, BankTransferPayment) only handles one type of payment.
2. Open/Closed Principle:
    The new payment can be added without changing the existing code.(by adding new file MethodName.java in payments directory and add its case in main)
3. Interface Segregation Principle:
    interface is simple and don't contain unused things
4. Dependency Inversion Principle:
    the PaymentProcessor class depends on abstract PaymentMethod interface
