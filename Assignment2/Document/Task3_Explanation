What SOLID Principles i used:
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
    Each class has one job.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
    Extendable without code modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
    Subclasses replace parent class easily.
4. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    Depend on abstractions, not implementations.

What Design Patterns i used:
1. Factory Method Pattern:
    to create objects

1. Which Creational Design Pattern would be most appropriate for this scenario? Why?
    The Factory Method pattern is most appropriate because it allows the system to create different types of documents (PDF, Word)
    without specifying the exact class, making it easy to add new document types in the future.
